\section{Introduction}
 \label{sec:intro}

 The NGC 2516 open cluster (also known as: Melotte 82, Caldwell 96,
 Collinder 172, or Southern Beehive) is a bright cluster visible with the naked
 eye in the southern skies, almost at the center of the Carina constellation.
 It is one of the approximately one hundred cataloged clusters located at a
 distance less than 500 pc away from the solar system.
 Because of its closeness, young age ($\sim 100$ Myr), and clear photometric
 sequence, it has been observed and studied consistently for almost one hundred
 years.
 % The Raab mention is taken from Cox (1955); 10.1086/146028
 \citet{Raab_1922} classified it as a ``very large, thin, irregular,
 well defined cluster containing a very great number of stars, many of which are
 very bright''.
 % Raab quote end with: ``The condensation is conspicuous, but the dispersion
 % unequal.''
 More than 600 references are returned today in a quick SIMBAD bibliography
 search.\footnote{\url{http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/}}\\

 Recently \cite{Borodina_2021} showed that cluster masses increase linearly with
 binary fraction, when binary stars are taken into account. This is: cluster
 masses are underestimated if the presence of binaries is neglected.

 \cite{Kouwenhoven_2009} demonstrated a similar but inverse effect for the
 dynamical masses, i.e. that not taking binary systems into account results in
 an overestimation of the dynamical mass.


 In \citet{Perren_2015}...\\


 This paper is organized as follows: in Section~\ref{sec:data} we
 present the data used in this work. Sections~\ref{sec:structure}
 and~\ref{sec:membership} show the structural and membership analysis,
 respectively.

 Results are summarized in Section \ref{sec:results}. Finally, our
 conclusions are given in Section \ref{sec:conclusions}.



%-------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Gaia EDR3 data}
 \label{sec:data}

 The data used throughout this article is taken from the Gaia EDR3
 survey~\citep{GaiaEDR3_2020}. We downloaded a region of 4x4 deg$^2$ centered
 on $(\alpha_{2016}=119.5167, \delta_{2016}=-60.7533)$, using the
 Vizier\footnote{\url{https://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR}} service.

 % Why the magnitude cut? Godoy-Rivera et al. (2021):
 % >...G >= 18.5 mag. At this apparent magnitude, instead of continuing to the
 % bottom-right part of the diagram, the probable members start to turn to bluer
 % colors for fainter magnitudes. This feature has already been found by other
 % works when using the Gaia DR2 photometry (e.g., Arenou et al. 2018; Lodieu et
 % al. 2019a,b; Smart et al. 2019), and it arises from an overestimation of the
 % flux in the GBP passband for faint, red sources (Riello et al. 2018, 2020).
 A magnitude cut on $G=18$ mag was imposed on the data resulting in a total of
 114512 sources for the complete frame. Of these, only 882 sources contained
 missing information in either the parallax, proper motions, or photometry,
 and were thus discarded from the fundamental parameters analysis.
 The reason for using only stars with $G\leq18$ mag is that below
 $G\approx18.5$ mag the Gaia color $BP-RP$ starts
 to become more negative, shifting the stars towards a non-physical (bluer)
 region of the color-magnitude diagram (CMD). This effect is attributed
 to an overestimation of the flux in the $BP$ passband for faint
 sources~\citep{Godoy_2021}. This artifact in the photometry would obviously
 have a negative impact on the CMD analysis, presented in
 Sect.~\ref{sec:fund_pars}. In addition, below $G=18$ mag the uncertainties of
 not only the photometry but also the proper motions and parallax start
 exponentially growing to very large values. This cut allows us to keep the
 sub-sample of data with the lowest uncertainties.

 %
 % Completeness Gaia EDR3
 % Fabricius et al. (2020):
 % For bright sources, detection efficiency starts to drop at G~3 mag
 %
 % Gaia Collaboration, Brown, A.G.A., et al.
 % https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202039657
 % In combination with the still limited data treatment in crowded areas this
 % means that the survey limit in regions with densities above a few hundred
 % thousand stars per square degree can be substantially brighter than G = 20.
 % Fabricius et al. (2020) show that the completeness as measured on OGLE fields
 % is 100\% up to source densities of 2x10^5 deg^-2, while at higher densities the
 % completeness has improved with respect to Gaia DR2, staying close to 100\% up
 % to 6x10^5 stars deg^-2 and dropping to 50\% at densities over
 % 8x10^5 deg^-2
 As shown in~\cite{Fabricius_2020}, a 100\% completeness of Gaia EDR3 data is
 guaranteed up to $G=20$ mag for regions of density below $2\times10^5$
 deg$^{-2}$. Our downloaded Gaia EDR3 frame containing NGC 2516 has a maximum
 density that is smaller than $\sim1.1\times10^5$ deg$^{-2}$ at its peak.
 Hence, this guarantees that the studied cluster sequence is complete down to
 the lowest-mass stars. This is an important fact to establish, since the
 estimated total cluster mass depends heavily on the total number of
 identified true  members.\\

 \label{fig:ngc2516_4}
 \end{figure*}

 In Fig.~\ref{fig:ngc2516_4} we show the final Gaia EDR3 data analyzed in this
 work. The $(\alpha^{*}, \delta^{*})$ coordinates are displaced to the
 cluster's center, and the right ascension is multiplied by the cosine of the
 declination. In all four plots the position of the cluster visibly stands out
 from the remaining field stars.




%-------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Structural properties}
 \label{sec:structure}
 
 The region surrounding this cluster shows a markedly non-uniform distribution
 of field stars. This contamination appears mostly above $G\approx15$ mag, as
 seen in~Fig\ref{fig:density}.

 \begin{figure}
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=\hsize]{figs/dens_map.png}
 \caption{Density maps of the NGC 2516 frame, $N$ is the number of stars in
 each plot. Left: complete frame. Center: stars brighter than $G=15$ mag. Right:
 low mass stars below $G=15$ mag.}
 \label{fig:density}
 \end{figure}

 To estimate the radius we employed our \texttt{ASteCA}
 package~\citep{Perren_2015} to fit a King profile\citep{King_1962}, for stars
 up to $G=15$ mag.
 \cite{Pieres_2016}



%-------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Membership analysis}
 \label{sec:membership}

 In this section we present the membership estimation method and the final set
 of most likely member stars.

 A first coarse manual estimation of the total number of members was performed
 with the \texttt{glue} library\footnote{\url{http://glueviz.org/}}. This
 application allows the selection of a subset of data, linked throughout
 multiple dimensions. The process is as follows: we begin by selecting the
 clearly visible overdensity of stars in the space of proper motions. These are
 then filtered using the parallax dimension, keeping stars that don't deviate
 too much from the mean. Finally, the subgroup is filtered again in the
 coordinates space, to keep stars within 1.5 deg from the cluster's center 
 (the estimated radius, as explained in Sect.~\ref{sec:structure}).
 This simple method results in a group of approximately 1400 stars
 manually selected to be the most likely members.

 A second simple estimation

  \subsection{Identification of single/binary systems}
   \label{ssec:id_single_binaries}

   xxx
   
   % Valle et al. (2021), "Goodness of fit test...", Describes a two-step
   % process to identify binary systems, based on rejecting stars far away
   % from a fiducial line estimated in the CMD
   %
   % In OCs an average fraction of binaries of about 30\% (i.e. η = 0.3) is
   % expected  (see e.g. Gizis & Reid 1995; Bouvier et al. 2001; Böhm-Vitense
   % 2007; Boudreault et al. 2010; Khalaj & Baumgardt 2013; Sheikhi et al.
   % 2016; Borodina et al. 2019; Li et al. 2020)

    % Rubele et al. (2011):
    % https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/414/3/2204/1038836
    % The binary fraction is set to a value of 0.3 for binaries with mass ratios in
    % the range between 0.7 and 1.0, which is consistent with the prescriptions for
    % binaries commonly used in works devoted to recover the field SFH in the
    % Magellanic Clouds (e.g. Holtzman et al. 1999; Harris & Zaritsky 2001; Javiel,
    % Santiago & Kerber 2005; Noel et al. 2009). Notice that this assumption is
    % also in agreement with the few determinations of binary fraction for stellar
    % clusters in the LMC (Elson et al. 1998; Hu et al. 2010, both for NGC 1818, a
    % stellar cluster younger than ∼100 Myr).

    % [Arenou et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201833234) also
    % proposes a simple method to identify binaries:
    %
    % Binary stars were first selected and removed. We used a LOWESS fitting 
    % (Cleveland 1979) to follow the sequence, and removed binary star
    % candidates by clipping out sources with G_BP fluxes two error bars lower
    % and G_RP fluxes higher than the fitted relation.
    %
    % Cleveland 1979: https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:31665444

    % Borodina et al. (2021) https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:230524157
    % If not properly accounted for, unresolved binary stars can induce a bias
    % in the photometric determination of star cluster masses inferred from star
    % counts and the luminosity function

    Sollima et al. (2010) estimated a 66\% binary fraction, with a minimum of
    25\%. These are values for the core of the cluster.

    % Belokurov et al (2020) https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.496.1922B/abstract
    % For stars with unresolved companions, motions of the centre of light and
    % that of mass decouple, causing a single-source astrometric model to
    % perform poorly. We show that such stars can be easily detected with the
    % RUWE
    %
    % Bouma et al (2021)
    % To assess astrometric binarity, we used the renormalized unit weight error
    % (RUWE) from Gaia EDR3. For plotting purposes, we labeled anything with
    % RUWE exceeding 1.2 as an astrometric binary (11% of the overall cluster
    % sample; see e.g., Belokurov et al. 2020). To assess photometric binarity,
    % we fitted a spline to Figure 3, fixing the nodes by hand. We then labeled
    % any points brighter than 0.3 mag above the cluster sequence as photometric
    % binaries. This included 20% of the overall cluster sample.
    %
    % They find a binary fraction in the range 11%-20%
    %
    Using the RUWE statistic, the binary fraction estimated as Bouma et al 
    (2021) (i.e., RUWE>1.2) is around $\sim$14\%.



  %****************************************************************
  \subsection{Estimation of masses for binary systems}
   \label{ssec:mass_binaries}


   In \cite{Borodina_2021} the authors use a quadratic mass-luminosity relation
   for main sequence stars, to estimate the masses for the primary and secondary
   stars in a binary system.


%-----------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Results}
 \label{sec:results}

 % Mass segregation:
 % ---------------------------------
 \cite{Jeffries_2001}
 % We conclude that the evidence for mass segregation is strong when comparing
 % stars above and below about ~0.8 Mo
 %
 % This is perhaps a hint that at least some of the mass segregation in NGC 2516
 % is primordial, as has been supposed for some younger clusters (...) cluster
 % relaxation timescale - which is about 100 Myr for clusters of the size of NGC
 % 2516 



 % Binarity & Mass
 % ---------------------------------
 \cite{Gonzales_2000}
 % A binary frequency of more than 26% is found among the high-mass
 % main-sequence stars. This number rises to 46% if all suspected binaries are
 % included.


 \cite{Jeffries_2001}
 % binary fraction of 26+/-5% ; binary fraction estimated in this way is a lower
 % limit.
 % "mass segregation is clearly present"
 % "the total cluster mass might be significantly greater than just what we
 % have observed in our limited survey"
 % "The total mass of the cluster for stars with M>0.3 M is at least 950 M and
 % probably as high as 1200 M, depending on the metallicity, binary fraction
 % and mass-ratio distribution. Correcting for the fraction of stars that lie
 % outside our survey, but within the likely cluster tidal radius, may increase
 % this estimate to around 1240-1560"
 % "less massive stars and brown dwarfs contribute about a further 15 percent
 % to the mass of NGC 2516"
 % 
 % "We must provide a caveat here; our selection procedure is arbitrary to some
 % degree, and will exclude some genuine members and will include some
 % non-members"
 %
 % The total cluster mass is probably greater than we first estimated (...)
 % likely that the cluster is more massive by about a factor of 1.3.
 %
 % Combining the upper mass limit (1560) with the projection of 15% more mass
 % from low mass stars, I get ~1800 as the upper mass limit
 %
 % Healy & McCullough(2020) quote the mass range from Jeffires as: 1240-1560 Mo

 \cite{Sung_2002}
 % dm=7.77, E_BV=0.122, log(age)=8.2, [FE/H]=-0.1, b_fr=40% (minimum)

 % Jeffries, Thurston, & Pye 1997: [Fe/H]=-0.32
 % Jeffries, James, & Thurston 1998 could reach no definite conclusion (for the)
 % metallicity
 %
 % "One of important issues concerning NGC 2516 is its metallicity: is it sub-
 % or near-solar?"

 \cite{Bonatto_2005}
 % NGC 2516: Battinelli et al. (1994) give Rlim ≈ 1.9 pc and
 % mtot ≈ 282 M. Bergond et al. (2001) give d ≈ 0.4 kpc, an
 % age of ≈113 Myr, Rtidal = 1.9 pc and mtot ≈ 170 M. Tadross
 % et al. (2002) give d ≈ 0.4 kpc, age ≈ 63 Myr, Rlim ≈ 1.8 pc,
 % dGC ≈ 8.5 kpc and mtot ≈ 36 M. Jeffries et al. (2001) estimate
 % an age of ≈150 Myr and total mass of mtot ≈ 1240−1560 M.
 % They also detected a sharp change in the MF slope for stars
 % with 0.3 ≤ m(M) ≤ 0.7.
 %
 % We note that previous works gave exceedingly low values for the
 % stellar mass in NGC 2516, e.g. Bergond et al. (2001) estimate
 % mtot ≈ 170 M (for stars with m ≥ 1.1 M), while in Tadross
 % et al. (2002), mtot ≈ 36 M.
